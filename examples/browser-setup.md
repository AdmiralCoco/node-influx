# Browser Setup

For Node.js, `influx` can be installed and you can use it out of the box!

```
npm install --save influx@next
```

For browsers, this will also work provided you have a bundler which can polyfill Node modules, such as Browserify, Webpack, Jspm, or Rollup with [rollup-plugin-node-resolve](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-node-resolve).
